    Fixed memory leak in destructor of parsetree::Node and edited tests
    
    - the ~Node() did not free the array elements
    - fixed the basic_fragments tests as they did not cover the parser that well... while still being very long
    - fixed the lexer tests not being checked, now some tests fail
    - fixed memory leak bug in the parser due to improper parser actions
    - nuked launch.json to use lldb as gdb was disappointing
    - edited grammar so multidimensional array access *should be* illegal (more testing needed)

    Enabled r15 tests and fixed lexer to include super keyword
    
    - By lexing the super keyword, we prevent anything with super from being accepted as valid.
    - Java program declaring a variable name as "super" should be rejected.

    Added basic parsetree generation to Bison grammar file
    
    - Upload .vscode for better experience
    - Lexer now has the operator struct again, effectively undoing commit b24f02dc8
    - Each lexer struct is really a leaf node in the parse tree, we set this data type using api.value.type
    - Parser rules now generate the parse tree
    - Disabled tests in lextests for now. However, HelloWorld still works.
